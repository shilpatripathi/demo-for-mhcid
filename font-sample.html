      <p class="lede"> A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
      <p class="copy"> At first you might think that Prof. Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here. 
        A little anecdone in passing over there. Upon reflection, it would become apparent that the mentions belied a deep set obsession
